A mock Professional Portfolio made as an assignment for the UW coding boot camp assignment on 06/23/22. I hope that I can use as a reference to make a real one for future use.

## Confidence in Assignment

---

This one I was a little less confident with my performance, something about CSS really trips me up especially when it comes to the nesting of things. I hope that over the next few months that this will get better. Either way this assignment really showed me that I will need a tutor's help especially when it comes to my orginization.
